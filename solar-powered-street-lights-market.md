<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Solar Powered Street Lights Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Standalone</li><li>Grid Connected</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The solar powered street lights market is primarily divided into two types: standalone and grid-connected. Standalone systems operate independently, using solar panels and batteries to store energy, making them ideal for remote areas without access to electricity. Grid-connected systems, on the other hand, integrate with the existing power grid, allowing for energy storage and backup from the grid when sunlight is insufficient. Both solutions offer sustainable lighting options, but their applications and dependency on the power infrastructure differ significantly.</p></p>
