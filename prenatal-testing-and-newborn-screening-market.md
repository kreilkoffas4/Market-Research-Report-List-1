<p><h1>Prenatal Testing and Newborn Screening Market Size and Growth, Market Segmentation, Regional and Country Breakdowns, and Market Trends for Period from 2025 -  2032</h1></p><p><strong>Prenatal Testing and Newborn Screening Market Analysis and Latest Trends</strong></p>
<p><p>Prenatal testing involves a range of medical tests conducted during pregnancy to assess the health of the fetus and screen for genetic, chromosomal, or congenital conditions. Newborn screening, on the other hand, refers to tests performed shortly after birth to identify potential health issues that could affect a newborn's long-term health and development. Both practices play a crucial role in early detection and intervention, enabling better health outcomes for infants and expecting mothers.</p><p>The Prenatal Testing and Newborn Screening Market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 8.20% during the forecast period, driven by advancements in technology, increased public awareness regarding fetal health, and the rise in maternal age. The growing prevalence of genetic disorders and the demand for non-invasive testing options further contribute to market expansion. Moreover, innovations such as next-generation sequencing and point-of-care testing are transforming traditional approaches, enhancing the accuracy and efficiency of screenings. As healthcare systems focus on preventive care and personalized medicine, the market is poised for significant growth, reflecting evolving patient preferences and the continuous development of novel diagnostic solutions.</p></p>
